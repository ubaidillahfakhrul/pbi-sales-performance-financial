# üìä Financial Sales Performance Dashboard

Welcome to the **Financial Sales Performance Dashboard** ‚Äî a dynamic and insightful Power BI report designed to monitor and evaluate sales performance over time. This dashboard provides a clear snapshot of actual vs. target sales, monthly goal achievements, and individual salesperson effectiveness.

---

## üéØ Objective

The purpose of this dashboard is to:

- Track actual sales (**Total_Sales_Actual**) versus planned sales targets (**Total_Sales_Target**) on a monthly basis.
- Identify how many months met or missed their sales goals.
- Highlight top-performing and underperforming salespeople with visual indicators and trend lines.
- Provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## üìà Summary

### Overall Sales Performance (YTD):

| Metric              | Amount       |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Actual Sales        | $18.9M       |
| Target Sales        | $19.3M       |
| Variance            | -$366.9K     |
| Variance Percentage | -1.9%        |
| Months Target Met   | 2 out of 14  |

### Monthly Trends:

- Sales targets were only met in **January 2023** and **July 2023**.

| Kaine Padly       | $767K  | $704K  | +9.0%      | ‚≠ê Top Performer  |

## üí° Key Insights

- Only **14% of the months** achieved sales targets, indicating the need for performance reassessment.
- The downward trend since **November 2023** raises concern ‚Äî internal factors or market dynamics may need investigation.
- Top performers like **Kaine Padly** can offer best practices to replicate across the team.
- Months that achieved targets (**Jan & Jul 2023**) should be further analyzed to uncover what drove success.
- An early warning system or predictive model could help in proactively addressing declining trends.

## üß† Why This Dashboard Stands Out

- ‚úÖ Clean and intuitive layout
- ‚úÖ Effective use of visual alerts (red/green markers)
